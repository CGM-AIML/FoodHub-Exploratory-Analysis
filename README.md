## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Python Foundations** course in the UT Austin / Great Learning Post Graduate Program in AI & ML (2025–2026).
The analysis reveals patterns in FoodHub's customer behavior, order frequency, and retention, and offers data-driven recommendations for enhancing performance.

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualizations of order distribution and customer activity
- Insights into customer retention and churn patterns

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## Key Insights
