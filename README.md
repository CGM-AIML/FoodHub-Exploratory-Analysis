# FoodHub — Exploratory Data Analysis & Customer Insights

## Executive Summary
FoodHub operates in a highly competitive food aggregation market where customer retention, ordering frequency, and service consistency directly impact revenue and platform growth. This project applies structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) to FoodHub’s customer order data to uncover behavioral patterns influencing demand, repeat usage, and long-term retention.

The analysis treats EDA as a **decision-support capability**, establishing a data-driven foundation for customer engagement strategy, operational improvements, and downstream predictive modeling.

## Business Objective
Use exploratory data analysis to:
- Identify customer ordering and engagement patterns
- Understand the primary drivers of repeat usage and retention
- Translate statistical findings into actionable business recommendations

The objective is to inform strategic decisions related to customer experience, service reliability, and demand optimization.

---

## Data Overview
- Historical customer order data from a food aggregation platform
- Mixed numeric and categorical features, including:
  - Order frequency and volume
  - Customer activity levels
  - Restaurant and cuisine attributes
- Behavioral indicators relevant to retention and churn analysis

---

## Analytical / Technical Approach

### 1. Data Preparation
- Data validation, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Handling of missing values and inconsistent categorical labels
- Feature standardization to support consistent analysis

### 2. Exploratory Analysis Strategy
- Univariate analysis to understand distributions and central tendencies
- Multivariate analysis to uncover relationships between customer behavior and ordering patterns
- Visualization of demand trends, customer activity, and engagement signals

### 3. Evaluation Methodology
- Pattern identification focused on retention-related behavior
- Comparative analysis across customer segments and activity levels
- Interpretation of findings through a business-impact lens

---

## Key Findings
- Repeat-order behavior is the strongest driver of overall customer retention.
- Customer activity patterns reveal opportunities to improve service touchpoints and order consistency.
- Ordering cadence and engagement frequency provide stronger retention signals than individual transaction size.

---

## Limitations
- Analysis is observational and does not establish causal relationships.
- Findings are dependent on the quality and completeness of historical data.
- External factors such as promotions or market conditions are not explicitly modeled.

---

## Next Steps
- Customer segmentation based on observed behavioral patterns
- Experimentation and A/B testing informed by identified retention drivers
- Integration of findings into predictive modeling and recommendation systems
